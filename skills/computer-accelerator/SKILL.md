# Computer Accelerator

Use this skill to find the process-level cause of a Windows slowdown and produce a measured before/after result. Use the `Optimize` mode as the normal acceleration entry point: it classifies the current bottleneck, records CPU/I/O/memory evidence with process IDs and command lines, applies only evidence-backed safe actions, waits for the machine to settle, and verifies the result. Combine Windows-native counters with three optional tools: System Informer for process and I/O attribution, LibreHardwareMonitor for temperature and clock telemetry, and Mem Reduct for an explicit, manual memory-trim test. Treat WinUtil as an optional maintenance tool, never as an unattended optimizer.

## Workflow

1. Run the adaptive optimization entry point:

```powershell
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File "$skillRoot\scripts\accelerate_windows.ps1" -Mode Optimize -OutputPath "$env:TEMP\computer-accelerator-optimize.json"
```

 This command captures the baseline, classifies CPU/memory/disk pressure, lowers only the exact evidence-backed background watcher processes when CPU or disk pressure is present, stops only safe read-only scan processes when disk pressure is present, waits for the system to settle, and writes a verification result with `Outcome` set to `Improved`, `NoOptimizationNeeded`, `NoSafeAction`, or `NotResolved`.

When the user reports intermittent lag but a single snapshot is normal, monitor while reproducing it:

```powershell
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File "$skillRoot\scripts\accelerate_windows.ps1" -Mode Monitor -DurationSeconds 60 -OutputPath "$env:TEMP\computer-accelerator-monitor.json"
```

`Monitor` is read-only. It records peak CPU, disk queue/latency, hard page reads, DPC/interrupt time, and the processes observed at the peaks; it does not stop anything. It marks WMI and PowerShell sampling overhead separately so the diagnostic process is not mistaken for the user's root cause.

For low-level inspection, capture a baseline before changing anything:

```powershell
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File "$skillRoot\scripts\accelerate_windows.ps1" -Mode Snapshot -OutputPath "$env:TEMP\computer-accelerator-before.json"
```

To explicitly schedule the confirmed background watchers without stopping them:

```powershell
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File "$skillRoot\scripts\accelerate_windows.ps1" -Mode Schedule -OutputPath "$env:TEMP\computer-accelerator-schedule.json"
```

`Schedule` changes only the priority of processes whose complete command line matches the confirmed bridge watcher, Codex log watcher, or active `sqlite3` `logs_2.sqlite` `session_loop` query. It records the PID, complete command line, original priority, and new priority in `%TEMP%\computer-accelerator-schedule-state.json`. Restore the saved priorities with:

```powershell
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File "$skillRoot\scripts\accelerate_windows.ps1" -Mode RestoreSchedule -OutputPath "$env:TEMP\computer-accelerator-restore-schedule.json"
```

2. Classify the bottleneck from the snapshot or `Optimize` diagnosis:

- CPU pressure: total processor time is sustained above 85% and one or more processes explain it.
- Memory pressure: available memory is below 2048 MB, commit is near its limit, or one process keeps growing across two snapshots.
- Paging pressure: available memory is below 4096 MB and hard page reads are sustained above 20/sec; ordinary soft page faults alone do not qualify.
- Disk pressure: a logical disk queue stays above 2 or average transfer latency stays above 20 ms.
- Thermal pressure: hardware telemetry shows sustained high temperature with clock reduction.
- Hardware fault pressure: unhealthy physical-disk status or recent storage/WHEA warning and error events are present.
- Scheduling pressure: sustained DPC or interrupt time is high; use a trace tool for driver attribution before changing anything.
- Log-watcher pressure: a large Codex `logs_2.sqlite` database is being polled by `resume-codex-app-threads.ps1 -Watch`; inspect retention before changing or deleting logs.
- Long-running watcher pressure: a project bridge, file watcher, hot-reload process, or sync loop with `--watch`/`-Watch` has a high CPU or I/O peak; identify its project role before pausing it.
- Background-task pressure: stale read-only scans, known disk analyzers, duplicate development servers, tests, sync clients, Docker/WSL, or browser automation are active. A Codex read-only scan running for at least 30 seconds is treated as stale and may be stopped even if the instantaneous disk queue has temporarily fallen.

3. Apply only an evidence-backed, reversible action. The adaptive entry point may stop a Codex-launched `robocopy` command only when its command line contains `/L`, `/S`, and `/BYTES`; stop a Codex-launched `Get-ChildItem`/PowerShell command that recursively searches a whole drive root when it is stale or causing disk pressure; or stop the exact `Krokiet`, `WizTree`, or `WizTree64` process when the current baseline shows high disk queue or transfer latency. These are scan processes, not file operations. Do not stop arbitrary processes, Docker/WSL, development servers, security software, or user applications.

When CPU or disk pressure is present, `Optimize` may also lower the priority of the four exact watcher patterns identified in the measured diagnosis. This preserves the watcher functionality and is reversible through `RestoreSchedule`; it does not change configuration, services, registry settings, log files, or power settings.

```powershell
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File "$skillRoot\scripts\accelerate_windows.ps1" -Mode Apply -StopReadonlyScans -OutputPath "$env:TEMP\computer-accelerator-apply.json"
```

For a measured disk-scan bottleneck, add the explicit observed-scanner action:

```powershell
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File "$skillRoot\scripts\accelerate_windows.ps1" -Mode Apply -StopObservedDiskScanners -OutputPath "$env:TEMP\computer-accelerator-apply.json"
```

4. Verify and report the real change:

```powershell
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File "$skillRoot\scripts\accelerate_windows.ps1" -Mode Verify -OutputPath "$env:TEMP\computer-accelerator-after.json"
```

Compare `Outcome`, `RootCauseCandidates`, CPU, available memory, page-read rate, physical-disk health, storage/WHEA fault signals, DPC/interrupt time, Codex log health, per-volume queue length, average latency, top CPU/I/O processes, and the targeted scan lists. For intermittent symptoms, use `Monitor` peaks instead of a single average. `RootCauseCandidates` are evidence-backed candidates, not proof of causality; a candidate is actionable automatically only when `SafeAutomaticAction` is true. Never delete, compact, or rotate a large Codex log database automatically. `Improved` means at least one pressure class present before the action cleared after it. `NoSafeAction` means pressure remains but the skill found no safe automated action; report the named process and its measured evidence instead of killing it. If verification still attributes pressure to a protected Codex/ChatGPT process or another non-schedulable process, keep the result as `NotResolved`, report that process and its measured evidence, and do not broaden the scheduling target set automatically. Never claim optimal performance from a successful command alone.

## Tool integration

Use the official package sources listed in [references/toolchain.md](references/toolchain.md). Install tools only through the explicit `InstallTools` mode after the user requests the integrated toolchain:

```powershell
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File "$skillRoot\scripts\accelerate_windows.ps1" -Mode InstallTools
```

Do not enable automatic memory cleaning by default. Mem Reduct changes Windows cache and working-set state through native APIs; use it only as a manual diagnostic experiment after recording a baseline. If memory returns to the same level immediately, identify the leaking process instead of scheduling more cleaning.

## Safety boundaries

- Never delete Desktop, Documents, Downloads, media, backups, chat databases, project files, or browser profiles.
- Never modify the registry, pagefile, services, boot configuration, Defender settings, Windows component storage, or power limits automatically.
- Never run WinUtil's full tweak/debloat/update surface as part of acceleration.
- Never run a cleanup tool just because free space is low; first identify the path and measure the effect.
- Never lower priority for a process based only on its name; scheduling requires an exact command-line match and a saved PID/command-line state record.
- Never restore a saved priority when the PID no longer has the same complete command line; report the mismatch instead.
- Preserve both before and after JSON snapshots when claiming an improvement.
- Treat "optimal" as the best measured state reachable through the current safe action set; do not promise that one run can solve an external workload, thermal limit, hardware fault, or user application leak.
- If a tool is not installed, report that fact and continue with Windows-native diagnostics.
