# Kuaishou Video Scout

## Purpose

Choose the video worth making now. Optimize for fast production, clear viewer benefit, and platform fit.

## Intake

Collect or infer:

- Account positioning and target audience
- Monetization goal or conversion path
- Available footage, screenshots, product images, scripts, links, or competitor examples
- Constraints: deadline, editing capacity, risk tolerance, required language, and whether web research is allowed

## Selection Workflow

1. **Inventory material**
   - List each candidate asset with format, duration, visual strength, uniqueness, and missing pieces.
   - Mark assets that can publish today versus assets requiring a new edit.

2. **Score ideas**
   - Score each candidate from 1-5 on:
     - Hook strength
     - Audience pain/desire
     - Proof or visual clarity
     - Production speed
     - Compliance risk
     - Fit with account positioning
   - Prefer fast, concrete, low-risk ideas over vague high-effort concepts.

3. **Pick primary and backup**
   - Select one primary idea and one backup.
   - Explain the winning reason in one sentence.
   - State the first 3 seconds hook before moving into production.

4. **Hand off**
   - If the selected idea needs a script or edit plan, hand off to `$kuaishou-video-maker`.
   - If a finished video already exists, hand off to `$kuaishou-publish-packager`.

## Research Rules

- For web search or page reading, use `jina-search` by default.
- Look for recent platform trends, user comments, competitor hooks, and recurring objections.
- Do not copy competitor copy or footage; extract structure, angle, and viewer promise.
